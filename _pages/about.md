I'm a CSE Senior at <a href="iiit.ac.in" target="_blank">IIIT-Hyderabad</a> working on robotic vision research at the <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank">Robotics Research Center</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ" target="_blank">Dr. K Madhava Krishna</a>. My current project is on indoor layout estimation from RGB Images.

Apart from this, I'm currently working with Prof. Makarand Tapaswi and Prof. Vinoo Alluri on generating soundtracks for books based on their movie adaptation using techniques in vision and language processing. I have also briefly worked with Prof. Vinoo Alluri previously on a project in Music Cognition to analyse correlation between structure in songs and listener preferences.

I've also interned with Prof. Derek Reilly at the <a href="https://gem.cs.dal.ca/" target="_blank">Graphics and Experiential Media (GEM) Lab</a> at Dalhousie University via the MITACS Globalink Program on building navigation rules for non-playable characters in augmented reality stories using spatial attributes.

At IIIT, I have also served as the Chief Editor of <a href="https://pingiiit.org" target="_blank">Ping!</a>, the independent student media body (2019-21). I've also been a part of the Entreprenurship Cell as a web developer and logistics team member.
