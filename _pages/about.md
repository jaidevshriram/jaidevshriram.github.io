<span class="h1">Hey! I'm Jaidev</span>

<span class="h5"><mark class="highlight">Generative AI + 3D Vision @ UCSD</mark><span>

My favourite pieces of tech make me feel creative, simplify difficult tasks, or are just plain weird. If it involves computer vision and machine learning, I'm likely trying to build that tech. 

I'm a second-year master's student in computer science at UC San Diego, advised by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/" target="_blank">Prof. Ravi Ramamoorthi</a>. My research interests lately revolve around 3D generatiion using diffusion models. I'm also exploring some exciting ideas in narrative understanding with <a href="https://haijunxia.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Haijun Xia</a>. Previously, during my undergrad at IIIT-Hyderabad, I worked on generative music for book soundtracks using multi-modal techniques. Broadly, I'm interested in using ML to boost human creativity and investigate ways to simplify complex workflows.

My Erdős number is four. My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers" target="_blank">Bacon number</a> is ∞ (happy to play an extra in a movie to fix this).
