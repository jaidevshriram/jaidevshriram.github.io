As part of the 'Design and Analysis of Software Systems' course, my team of four worked with subtl.ai - a startup at CIE - IIIT Hyderabad. After extensive discussions with the subtl.ai team, we prototyped and iterated through many versions of the product, as per their requirements.

The final product had 

1. Backend APIs that use socket.io to communicate with their NLP solution 

2. Dashboard to onboard users and view product analytics

We used node.js for the APIs, and Django for the dashboard
